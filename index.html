            <h2>Agreements</h2>
            <p>These were the agreements between the Indigenous peoples and the Crown:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The tribes gave up their lands within specified boundaries to the Queen.</li>
                <li>Beginning at the south line of St. Peter's Parish, 
                    the Crown will give 160 acres for each family of five, or in that proportion
                    for larger or smaller families, so if there is a family of 4, they will get 128 acres 
                    for example and the proportions will continue according to the amount of people in the family.</li>
                <li>At some period in July, the tribes will be receiving a payment of 15 Canadian dollars in goods
                    such as blankets, clothing, prints (assorted colours), twine or traps or if permitted by the Crown
                    can be given in cash. This payment will be received by family every month in July according
                    to the proportion of people per family. A family of 5 will receive 15 Canadian dollars and for example,
                    if it is a family of 4, the payment will be 12 Canadian dollars, however each chief will get
                    an additional payment of 20 Canadian dollars in goods or cash and an additional suit of clothing
                    to the chief every three years.</li>
                <li>At the treaty's signing, every tribe member gets a gift worth 3 Canadian dollars.</li>
                <li>If the reserve desires, the Queen permits a school to be maintained on the reserve.</li>
                <li>Alcohol and intoxicating liquor is not permitted to be sold or introduced on reserves.</li>
                <li>The Queen and the tribes promised peace between the settlers and the tribes.</li>

            <h2>How is treaty 1 different from other treatys?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The treaty was among the first of the treaties signed by the Indigenous people.</li>
                <li>Treaty 1 had very specific geographic focuses on where it will be located unlike the other treaties.</li>
                <li>The prohibition of alcohol was rarely signed on treaties, but on Treaty 1, it did.</li>
